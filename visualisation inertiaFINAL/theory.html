<!--Theory-->
<h3 class='text'style="top:100px; left:50px;">Moments of Inertia - Theory</h3>
<h5 class='text' style="top:180px; left:50px;"><b>1. Introduction</b></h5>
<p class='text' style='top:230px; left:50px;'>
When a particle or a body enter rotational motion, equivalents can be drawn from linear motion.
However, there are some key differences that must<br>
be addressed. For instance, as shown in the first simulation, when the distance from the axis of rotation of a point mass increases while its mass<br>
and kinetic energy remain constant, the tangential velocity of the mass decreases. This implies that for a rigid body or a system of particles rotating<br>
about an axis, all particles have a different tangential velocity, dependent on the radius of its circular path. Therefore, a quantity that relates to the<br>
speed of rotation and is independent of this distance is required, which is known as the angular velocity or frequency, and measured in radians per<br>
second. It is defined in eq.(1), where 'r' is the radius of the circular path and 'T' is the time taken for one complete path (one oscillation).
<br> <br>
Torque, or moment of force, is commonly referred to as the rotational analogue of force, being responsible for any angular acceleration. It also shows a<br>
dependency on the distance from the axis of rotation, as displayed in eq.(2) as the cross product of the position and force vectors. Therefore, there is a<br>
quantity that can be treated as the rotational equivalent of mass, representing a body's tendency to resist angular acceleration. This quantity is defined<br>
as the moment of inertia, shown in eq.(3) for a point mass.

<h5 class='text' style="top:530px; left:50px;"><b>2. Rotational Equivalents of Linear Motion</b></h5>
<p class="text" style="left:50px; top:600px;">
The moment of Inertia is sometimes referred to as the 'rotational equivalent' of mass for linear motion.<br>
It is the sum of the mass of each particle in the body with the square of the distance from the axis of rotation,<br>
As previously mentioned and shown in eq.(3). While mass is also an important component in resisting rotational<br>
motion, just as in linear motion, it also shows a large dependencer on the displacement of each point mass from the<br>
axis of rotation. This can be visually seen through the visualization. When the mass(kg) of one point mass is equal<br>
the distance(m) of the other and vice versa, the heavier one closer to the axis of rotation will have a greater angular<br>
velocity. Furthermore, other rotational quantities also have linear equivalents, as shown in the table to the right.<br>
	<br>
To quantify the dependence of both mass and distance from the axis of rotation together, the moment<br>
of inertia was defined. For a rigid body (where defomation is negligible) rotating about its center of mass,<br>
the moment of inertia can be found through the sum of the moments of inertia of its infinitely many constituent<br>
point masses. In mathematical terms, this relationship can be represented by the following equation:
